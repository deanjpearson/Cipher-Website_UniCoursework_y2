        <h1 class="title">Mirror Writing Cipher</h1>

        <p>I found Mirror Writing under the classical ciphers page on <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Classical_ciphers">Wikipedia</a>
            although to me it did seem odd it was considered a cipher but as the Oxford Dictionary states a cipher is
            <i>"A secret or disguised way of writing; a code."</i> so it does 'disguise' the text.
        </p>

        <p>Mirror Writing is actually fairly common and is used on some emergency service vehicles in the UK.</p>

        <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
        <p> Apparently Leonardo Da Vinci used to write his notes and personal messages with mirror
            writing! I mean I don't know how successful he was at 'encrypting' his personal messages
            but I am going to go ahead and say not very....but hey, it was early in the 16th Century so we have come
            along
            way since then and he done some pretty cool things!
