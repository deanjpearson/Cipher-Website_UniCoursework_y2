        <p>
            I thought it was appropriate to start off with the cheesiest, most overused phrase when it comes to web
            development but there's nothing wrong with adding a bit of cheesyness to your coursework, right?
        </p>

        <p>
            This project is part of the coursework within the degree course for BSc(Hons) Web Design and Development
            at <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/en/courses/bsc-hons-web-design-and-development-undergraduate-fulltime">Edinburgh
            Napier University</a>, where I currently study.
            <br>

        <div class="thetask">
            <h2>The task:</h2>
            The task we have been given is to create a website that offers great functionality and shows off classical
            ciphers that we will create and code and implement using
            Javascript.<br><br>
            My website consists of;
            <ul>
                <li>an index.html page(the one you are looking at right now)</li>
                <li>A design page which will outline relevant design decisions taken.</li>
                <li>ROT 13 - Caesar Cipher</li>
                <li>Mirror Writing Cipher</li>
                <li>Atbash Cipher</li>
            </ul>
            There is of course a js folder which contains the javascript file needed for the ciphers, a fonts folder
            which contains the local files of the custom font declared
            in the css file which is also within its own folder, in order to follow the 'standard' structure for
            websites.
