# This repo contains a coursework from second year of University. It was a project in Web Technologies module.

The coursework was to:
* Create a basic website using base HTML and CSS without the use of further libraries etc...
* Implement 3 different classical cyphers by using javascript.
* Create a design page that describes the reasoning of each design decision. 

The coursework isn't the prettiest but it works and served its purpose gaining a grade of 70%. 
The 70% grade was described as:
> **70-100%** - A submission in this mark band will demonstrate that you have gone
beyond the core learning for the module and have actively pursued your own
learning path. Your submission will include a site that goes beyond the core
techniques discussed in class and lab sessions and that offers an excellent level of
functionality combined with a rewarding user experience. You will have evaluated
your design using appropriate techniques. You will have implemented more
advanced features that have not been specifically covered in the practical sessions
and which you will have investigated for yourself. Your design and code will be
excellent. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be well organised. Your report will be comprehensive, very well written and presented, and will correctly reference all
the material you have used. This is likely to include textbooks, online forums and
tutorials and some of the suggested reading for the module.
